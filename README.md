# ARR_Rollup_Challenge

Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to design and implement an ARR (üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è) Rollup solution for Acme, Inc. This solution should be repeatable and reliable.

 Note : ARR stands for Annual Recurring Revenue.

Acme, Inc. needs to know how much revenue Acme is receiving from each account, and how much revenue Acme receives from an entire account hierarchy.


Tables of the Database
Below, you will find three CSV files which will act as your database.

# Account Hierarchy
Account hierarchies are important to keep track of as companies can form complex structures. In Acme‚Äôs case, they will sell to any legal entity. So if multiple companies in the same account hierarchy would like to buy Acme‚Äôs product, then that is allowed.

 Note : Some companies will only sell to the ultimate parent company so even they need to understand a company‚Äôs hierarchy so they are selling to the right people.

Let‚Äôs use the Umbrella Corporation as an example of a company structure.

 

Let‚Äôs establish some key terms using the diagram above:

‚óè	Ultimate Parent
‚óã	The ultimate parent is the account at the very top of the hierarchy.
‚óã	In the diagram above, Umbrella Corporation is the ultimate parent. No other account in that hierarchy is the ultimate parent. There can only be one ultimate parent in a hierarchy.
‚óã	If an account is by itself with no parent or child accounts, then the account will be its own ultimate parent account.
‚óè	Parent
‚óã	A parent is an account that has one or more child accounts.
‚óã	In the diagram above, Umbrella USA, Umbrella Europe, and Umbrella Medical are parent accounts.
‚óè	Child
‚óã	A child is an account that has a parent account, and has no child accounts.
‚óã	In the diagram above, Umbrella Pharmaceuticals, Umbrella Industries, Paraguas Line Company, and Umbrella Japan are child accounts.

There is no limit to how many child companies a parent company can have.

Once an account hierarchy is set up, you can calculate a key data point which is the ARR of the account hierarchy. Let‚Äôs say Umbrella USA is paying Acme $30,000, and Umbrella Medical is paying Acme $15,000. The ARR of the account hierarchy is $45,000.

# Requirements
Your task is to populate three columns in accounts.csv:

‚óè	ultimate_parent_id
‚óã	This column should be populated with the id of the ultimate parent account.

‚óè	arr
‚óã	This column should be populated with Acme‚Äôs revenue for the account.

‚óè	hierarchy_arr
‚óã	This column should be populated with Acme‚Äôs revenue for the entire account hierarchy.

You can use any programming language to complete this task.

The script should be repeatable, and maintainable. In lieu of a real database, treat the CSV files as tables in a database. The CSV files are large files to allow you to find ways to optimize your script.

We will ask for your output so that we can verify it.

For determining the ARR of an account, you will need to look at the subscriptions and subscription items. Take a look at the next section to see what the columns mean, and to determine how you can relate the data.

Only active subscriptions, and active subscription items should be considered for the ARR. An active subscription or subscription item is where the Start Date is today or earlier, and the End Date is today or later. Use the table below for reference:


Start Date	End Date	Active?
5/30/2022	5/29/2023	No
1/1/2023	12/31/2023	Yes
12/1/2023	11/30/2024	No
5/31/2023	5/30/2024	Yes

To determine the revenue for each subscription item, there are three data points provided:

‚óè	quantity
‚óã	The number of items that are being sold.
‚óè	list_price
‚óã	The annual list price of one item.
‚óè	discount
‚óã	The discount for the items. The format in the file will be 0.07 which is a 7% discount.

For an example, if someone from Umbrella Corporation buys 7 licenses that are $15 a year with a 10% discount, the ARR for that would be $94.50.

Once you have the ARR of each account, then you can calculate the ARR of the account‚Äôs hierarchy which will be the sum of the ARR of the accounts inside the hierarchy.
